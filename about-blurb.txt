tura.io is working on creating a multi-layered platform for real-time pattern recognition.

Use of personal and IOT devices has greatly increased the amount of user and sensor data that's floating through the internet.
Any successful modern data-driven company is building an AI framework that reacts to user behaviors and patterns in real-time.
At the heart of any such AI framework is a robust and complex pattern recognition software to detect user patterns in a correct and timely fashion.
Companies who identify and react to user/sensor patterns quicker create a competitive edge in the market place.

tura.io brings use of complex and higher math to the world of pattern recognition.
We provide a tool to map user/sensor data into real-time streams where our pattern recognition software detects predefined trends within your data.

We realize that trends can be very complex to detect and analyze. This is why we take a robust and multi-layered approach into defining trends.
Patterns detected by our pattern recognition software can be layered and used in complex order to each other to define actionable trends.
